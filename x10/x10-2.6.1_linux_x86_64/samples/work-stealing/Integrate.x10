/**
 * This is an updated implementation of the Integrate program
 * from the samples/tutorial directory to be used with
 * the -WORK_STEALING compiler option.
 * <p>
 * The computation is repeated 10 times.
 * The iteration time is reported.
 * <p>
 * To work around limitations of the current compiler
 * the following manual transformations have been applied:
 * The closure has been inlined for better performance.
 * Math.abs has been inlined for better performance.
 * Methods have been made static.
 * Variables that need not been saved across context switches
 * have been annotated @Ephemeral.
