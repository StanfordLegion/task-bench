/** \file
 * Serialization framework
 *
 * As a user, when preparing messages to send, you can use the definitions in
 * this file to help you pack data into a buffer for sending, without having to
 * worry about endianness, alignment, or padding.
 *
 * An example of serialization (note that the types of data and other_data must
 * be equally sized on both sides of the message, so it is best to use the
 * fixed-size types in stdint.h, such as uint64_t): \code

x10rt_serbuf b; x10rt_serbuf_init(&b, place, msg_id);
x10rt_serbuf_write(&b, &data);
x10rt_serbuf_write(&b, &other_data);
x10rt_send_msg(&b.p);
x10rt_serbuf_free(&b);

 * \endcode
 *
 * An example of deserialization:
 * \code

    x10rt_deserbuf b; x10rt_deserbuf_init(&b, p);
    uint64_t data1; x10rt_deserbuf_read(&b, &data1);
    uint64_t data2; x10rt_deserbuf_read(&b, &data2);

 * \endcode
