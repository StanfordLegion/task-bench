/*
 * Implementation of X10 interface dispatching using "searched itables."
 * A description of a number of alternative interface dispatching
 * mechanisms for Java, including this one, can be found in a paper by 
 * Alpern et al published in OOPSLA'01
 * http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=504282.504291.
 *
 * The basic idea is that interfaces generate secondary vtable-like structures,
 * known as itables. For every <class C, interface I> pair where C implements I,
 * a unique itable is defined as part of the C's meta-data. Each itable for C
 * is stored (along with I's unique id) in an array of itables reachable from
 * instances of C via the _getITables method of Reference.  To dispatch an interface
 * invocation, the generated code first calls findITable, passing in the
 * target object and the unique id of the interface being invoked.  findItable
 * gets the objects itables array, compares ids to find the right itable, and
 * returns it.  This returned itable is then indexed at a statically known offset
 * to get the desired function pointer, which is then invoked.
 *
 * There are a couple ways in which the implementation of itables in C++ for X10
 * diverges from the usual implementation for Java in JVMs.
 *   (a) C++ won't easily let us directly insert a pointer to a virtual function
 *       in the itable (whose nominal type needs to have a first argument of Reference
 *       instead of C*).  Therefore we have to use static method thunks to a pointer
 *       to a function that casts an explicit receiver parameter and invokes the
 *       appropriate virtual method on it.  There is a way to use templates to
 *       work around this, but it results in more complex itable instantiation code,
 *       so we are deferring using it in the initial implementation.
 *   (b) We're using the address of the interface'ss rtt field as the interface id
 *       instead of generating a unique integer. This is done to optimize the calling
 *       sequence for invokeinterface, since the address of the rtt field is a
 *       link-time constant.
 *   (c) X10 doesn't suffer from Java's "incompatible class change error" problem
 *       because it has a less dynamic notion of linking a program.  This implies that
 *       (modulo compiler bugs), a search of an itable will always succeed.
 *       For debugging purposes, we still pad itables with an extra sentinel entry,
 *       but failing to find an itable is a fatal error that aborts the program,
 *       not a runtime exception.
