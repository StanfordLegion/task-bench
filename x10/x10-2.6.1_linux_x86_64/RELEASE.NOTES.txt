X10 Release 2.6.1

HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS RELEASE

The focus of the X10 2.6.1 release is improvements to Resilient X10.
Some highlights include:
  - Significant improvements to the performance of resilient finish
  - A new resilient store implemented in X10
  - Improved standard library APIs for elasticity and
    non-shrinking recovery.
  - Enhancements to the x10.util.resilient.iterative package to
    exploit elasticity to support non-shrinking recovery.
  - Updating of all Resilient X10 sample programs and applications
    to showcase the improvements in Resilient X10.

LIMITATIONS OF THIS RELEASE

The size and index of arrays must be less than 2^31 with Managed X10.
An attempt to allocate a longer array causes IllegalArgumentException. 

The following features described in the 2.6 language manual do not
currently work and may be fixed in the subsequent releases:
  - Non-static type definitions as class or interface members
    (static type defs do work)

The constraint solver used by X10 typechecker is known to be incomplete 
for situations in which a constraint implies an infinite number of 
distinct constraints.

Additionally, the following features described in the language
manual do not currently work with Native X10.
  - Non-final generic instance methods
  - Exception stack traces on Cygwin

The generated C++ code requires g++ 4.2 or better to be compiled; 
we do almost all of our testing against g++ 4.4.
  + On Power/Linux and BG/Q, you may either use g++ 4.2 or better
    or xlC 11.1 or better.
