# To Do

  * Core API
      * Load imbalanced tasks
      * Load imbalanced task output
      * Other dependence types
          * Random
          * W/V cycles
          * K-nearest neighbors (as a way to measure overhead as a function of number of dependencies)
      * Other kernel types
          * Compute bound
          * Memory bound
          * I/O bound
      * Recursive task graphs?
      * GPUs?
      * Measure memory usage of runtimes
  * Legion Implementation
      * Profile and tune at scale
  * Build system
      * Is there a reasonable way to build without N build systems?
          * Maybe CMake?
  * Test suite
  * Potential Implementations
      * DARMA
      * Regent
      * OCR
      * X10
      * TensorFlow
      * Dask
      * Ray
      * Nimbus
